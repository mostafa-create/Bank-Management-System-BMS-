# Bank Management System (BMS)

A console-based bank management system is a software that allows users to manage bank accounts through a text-based interface. It's designed to support various functions related to handling different bank cards, including account inquiries, fund transfers, card activation/deactivation, and transaction history, all accessible via the command line. This system aims to provide a secure and efficient way to interact with multiple bank accounts and cards in a user-friendly manner, without the need for a graphical interface.
